# Autonomous Rescue Rover Dashboard

## Introduction
In the critical hours following natural disasters, first responders face immense challenges navigating collapsed structures and hazardous environments to locate survivors. Traditional search-and-rescue operations put human teams at risk while being constrained by fatigue, limited visibility, and inaccessible areas. Our Autonomous Rescue Rover system addresses these challenges through an intelligent, sensor-equipped robotic platform designed to:

**Navigate autonomously** through unstructured disaster zones without GPS reliance

**Detect survivors** using multi-modal sensor fusion (RFID, IR, ultrasonic, and motion detection)

**Deliver emergency** supplies with precision while conserving energy

**Operate continuously** through optimized power management
